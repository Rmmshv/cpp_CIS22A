Write a C++ program named "PrintShape" that will read in from the user the shape integer number (1 for triangle and 2 for square) and the character used in the printed shape. It then prints out the given shape using the given character. If the user did not enter 1 or 2 for the shape number, it will print out an error message.

For now, the shape can be a simple 3 lines.

Here are examples of different runs of the program:

D:\cis22a>PrintShape

Which character do you want to be used in the shape? @
