Write a C++ program named "AskForThreeAscendingNumbers" that will read in from the users 3 numbers. 
It makes sure that the 2nd number is always greater than the 1st and the 3rd number is always greater than the 2nd. 
If it is smaller, it will print out an error message and ask the user to re-enter the number until it is greater.

Once reading is complete, it will print out all 3 numbers.

 

Here is an example of the run output:

D:\cis22a>AskForThreeAscendingNumbers

Please enter 3 numbers in the ascending order.
Please enter 1st number: 100
Please enter 2nd number: 50
It is smaller than the first number. Please try again.
