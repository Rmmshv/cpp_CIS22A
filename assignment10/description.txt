1. Write a function named "countPositiveNegative" that accepts an array of integers, its size and return the number of
positive and negative in the array through the use of parameters. In addition, it also returns the number of 0s in the array
as the return value.
For example, array of {10, 20, -30, -40, 50, 0, 60} will return 4 for positives, 2 for negatives and 1 for 0's as the
return value.

2. Write a function named "rotateRight" that accepts an array of integers and its size. It will rotate all the values to
the right and move the value of the last element in the array to the first.
For example, array of {10, 20, 30} will become {30, 10, 20}.

3. Write a function named "countNonAlpha" that accepts a string. It will return the number of non-alphabet characters
(excluding blanks) in the string.
For example, if the string is "Hello, World!", it will return 2 for ',' and '!" in the string.
